## 📖 Introduction
**Speak2Play** is a mini voice assistant that demonstrates the integration of **speech recognition**, **text-to-speech**, and **media control**.  

It allows you to:
- Speak commands such as *“play [song name]”* 🎶  
- Convert your voice into text using **Google Speech Recognition**  
- Get a spoken response via **pyttsx3**  
- Play YouTube videos using **PyWhatKit**

The repository includes:
- `speech_app.py` → Main assistant script
